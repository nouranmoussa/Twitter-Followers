In this project, you are given a comma-separated file to represent some Twitter users and
the users they follow. The file name is “twitter.csv”. Each row represents a certain user’s id
and the id of another user he/she follows.
e.g.
1,2 //user with id = 1 follows the user with id = 2
2,5 //user with id = 2 follows the user with id = 5
3,5 //user with id = 3 follows the user with id = 5
1,6 //user with id = 1 follows the user with id = 6
You are required to make a program that stores this data in a suitable data structure that
helps your program to retrieve the Top-influencer that has the highest number of followers,
when required, and then the next Top-influencer and so on
